# Liquidity Risk

The Liquidity_Risk_AMG.ipynb contains everything - EDA, model training and evaluation. The sandbox folder contains some other models I was testing and experimenting with (some fun R&D), the images folder contains snapshots of the decision tree trained, and the data folder contains the tick data for security ABC. 

Just ensure you have the following modules installed:

* matplotlib
* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* math
* scipy
* pprint
* sklearn
* tpot

You can run all cells in the notebook as is once the modules are imported.
